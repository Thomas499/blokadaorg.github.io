b_unified_name = StevenBlack Unified
b_unified_comment = 3.1 A great choice that strives to keep balance between blocking effectiveness, battery impact and false positives. Try this list if other ones are blocking too much.
b_hphosts_name = HpHosts
b_hphosts_comment = A rigorous configuration which will block more ads, but may occasionally mistakenly block desired content. This is a good choice if the default choice is not effective enough for you.
b_mvps_name = MVPS
b_mvps_comment = 3.1.1 A lenient, less resource-intensive configuration which will omit more ads than the default one, but may improve battery life and device performance. This is a great choice if you are experiencing any issues with your device or apps. Included in Steven Black Unified, which means no need to enable this if Steven Black unified is enabled.
b_adaway_name = AdAway
b_adaway_comment = 3.1.2 Blocks mobile ad providers and some analytics providers. Included in Steven Black Unified, which means no need to enable this if Steven Black unified is enabled.
b_danpollock_name = Dan Pollock's hosts file
b_danpollock_comment = 3.1.3 A reasonably balanced ad blocking hosts file. Included in Steven Black Unified, which means no need to enable this if Steven Black unified is enabled.
b_pgl_name = Peter Lowe's hosts file

b_mining_name = Crypto-currency trading
b_mining_comment = A simple list that prevents unwanted mining of cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. By default StevenBlack Unified includes the important parts of this list which mine cryto-currency without user knowning. The difference is that this list also blocks valid crypto-currency exchange domains (e.g. coinbase.com, bittrex.com, etc.) that aren't involved with browser mining. For more info see https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/issues/949
b_social_name = Social hosts file
b_social_comment = Blocks social sites. Useful for blocking Facebook ads, but may block too much.
b_unified_porn_name = StevenBlack Unified + porn
b_unified_porn_comment = 3 Same as Unified, with additional blocking of sites with adult content. Note: In my experience, in college the ones who had the most controlling parents growing up were the most "active" and not in the way parents want their kids to be. Overcontrolling will backfire, they will find it somewhere else. But that's your call to make. 
b_energized_spark_name = Energized Spark
b_energized_spark_comment = 2.1.1.1 The most compact version of the Energized list. Good for devices with very little RAM. Everything in this list is included in the Energized Blu Go list so if Energized Basic, Energized Blu, or Engergized Ble Go is enabled no need to enable to one too.
b_energized_blu_go_name = Energized Blu Go (Recommended)
b_energized_blu_go_comment = 2.1.1 The little brother of Energized Blu, for devices with less available RAM. Everything in this list is included in the Energized Blu list so if Energized Basic, or Energized Blu is enabled no need to enable to one too. 
b_energized_blu_name = Energized Blu 
b_energized_blu_comment = 2.1 A reasonable list optimized for mobile devices, blocking most of the ads one can face browsing the net or running apps. Everything in this list is included in the Energized Basic list so if Energized Basic is enabled no need to enable to one too.
b_energized_basic_name = Energized Basic
b_energized_basic_comment = 2 For high end devices that have a lot of RAM. This list consists of ad domains, tracking scripts, malware and other from reputable sources always merged and unified into one list. The purpose of this list is to provide the best protection and cover most of advertisement, malware, spam and tracking in both web and apps.
b_goodbyeads_name = Goodbye Ads by Jerryn70
b_goodbyeads_comment = 1 Probably the cause of the problem if you have one, though energizer might be guilty also. Blocks mobile ads & trackers. Particularly designed for blocking ads in games & apps. Unlike other host files it also blocks ads provided by Facebook. This will also increase battery life and performance. Note: if you are a Facebook user, whitelist it to work properly.
b_common_whitelist_name = Anudeep Whitelist
b_common_whitelist_comment = Common whitelist selection to keep things like facebook, and youtube history from breaking. You probably don't need it on a firestick
